üö® CRITICAL AZURE APP REGISTRATION FIX NEEDED üö®
================================================

Your app registration has two critical issues that need immediate fixing:

ERROR 1: "msal.oauth2cli.oidc.Client.obtain_token_by_browser() got multiple values for keyword argument 'redirect_uri'"
‚úÖ FIXED: Removed explicit redirect_uri from code

ERROR 2: "The provided client is not supported for this feature. The client application must be marked as 'mobile.'"
‚ùå NEEDS FIXING: Your app registration is not properly configured for mobile/desktop apps

IMMEDIATE AZURE PORTAL FIX REQUIRED:
===================================

1. Go to https://portal.azure.com
2. Navigate to "Azure Active Directory" ‚Üí "App registrations"
3. Find your app: Client ID 93d09ad1-eee7-41cd-b10d-b665e0963861

4. üî¥ CRITICAL: Click "Authentication" in left menu

5. üî¥ CRITICAL: Add Platform for Mobile/Desktop:
   - Click "Add a platform"
   - Select "Mobile and desktop applications"
   - Add these redirect URIs:
     ‚úì http://localhost
     ‚úì https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient
     ‚úì msal93d09ad1-eee7-41cd-b10d-b665e0963861://auth

6. üî¥ CRITICAL: Set "Supported account types":
   Must be: "Personal Microsoft accounts only" OR
           "Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts"


   Scroll down to "Advanced settings"
   Set "Allow public client flows" = YES
   Set "Enable the following mobile and desktop flows" = YES

8. API Permissions (if not already set):
   - Microsoft Graph ‚Üí Delegated permissions:
     ‚úì Notes.Read
     ‚úì Notes.ReadWrite
   - Click "Grant admin consent"

9. Click "Save" at the top

WHY THIS IS HAPPENING:
=====================
- Your app is configured as a "Web" application
- Personal Microsoft accounts require "Mobile and desktop" application type
- Device code flow requires public client capabilities

AFTER MAKING CHANGES:
====================
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for Azure to propagate changes
2. Run: python create_pages.py
3. Authentication should work without errors

VERIFICATION:
============
Your app registration should show:
- Platform: "Mobile and desktop applications" ‚úì
- Redirect URIs: At least "http://localhost" ‚úì
- Supported accounts: Include personal accounts ‚úì
- Public client flows: Enabled ‚úì
